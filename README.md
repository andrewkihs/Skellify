# Skellify
Chrome extension that makes any website the shell of it's former self!

# Basics
This is a simple Chrome extension built in JavaScript. This extension uses HTML DOM tags to unpack the core elements of websites. In doing so, the website is virtually unreadable...except for a couple persistent div ids. Like a skeleton, this package is half diagnostic and half evil. It's meant to be both an exercise in visualizing the website accessibility as well as an exercise in futility.
